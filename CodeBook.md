Feature Selection 
=================


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 


Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 


Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Analysis
=================


Each data file (x and y test data, x and y train data, and the activity labels)  was read into R using read.table(), and merged together appropriately using cbind() and rbind(). 


Then, every feature that was not a mean or standard deviation was discarded.


Then, the activity labels (1-6), were given descriptive names (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying).


Then, the names of the features were cleaned up so as to not include any non-appropriate characters. (Parentheses, dashes, etc.)


Then, using the dplyr package, the data was grouped by activity, and the mean was taken for each feature.


The end result is a tidy data set with 6 rows and 80 columns.
